# odin-recipes
Before starting the project:
I expect to learn about all the HTML knowledge I've
learned so far by making a recipe website. It won't look
pretty, but I'll be able to practice what I've learned.

After the project:
I put into practice what I learned and am proud that I didn't need
to look up anything except how to put a caption on my images
(with <figure> and <figcaption>). This wasn't necessary but I felt
bad not putting any credit on the photos.
