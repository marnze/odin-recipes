        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>water as needed</li>
        <li>5 pounds potatoes, peeled</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
            Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, eggs and salt. Mix in a little water at a time until dough is somewhat stiff. 
            Roll dough in small sections about 1/4 inch thick. Using a large biscuit cutter or drinking glass, make circle cuts.</li>
        <li>To make filling: Mix together potatoes, cheese, salt, pepper and onion salt. 
            Fill each with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the potato mixture, fold over and seal edges. 
            To cook, bring a large pot of water to boil, carefully dropping in one at a time; stir once. They are done when they float to the top.</li>
